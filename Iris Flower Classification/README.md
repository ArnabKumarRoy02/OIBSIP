# Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on the Iris Flower Classification problem. The Iris Flower Classification is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on the lengths and widths of their sepals and petals.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Iris Flower Dataset](Iris.csv). The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples of each of the three species of iris flower (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica). Each sample contains the lengths and widths of the sepal and petal of the iris flower.
