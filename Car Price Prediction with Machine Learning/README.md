# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting car prices based on various features and attributes. The project utilizes popular machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that estimates the price of a car given its specifications.

## Dataset

The Dataset used in this project is the [Vehicle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=car+data.csv) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consists of a CSV file containing car information and corresponding prices. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure the quality and reliability of the model's predictions.
